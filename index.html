    <p class = 'project-intro1'>There are 1983 exonerees from 1989 to March 2017 in the United States. Murder is the primary crime of wrongful convictions with 779 exonerees, which is a tiny amount of population of the US. However, once the wrongful conviction occurs, life is no longer the same. The exonerees of murder have been waiting for about 16 years on average to be exonerated from the accused crime occurred. The longest duration is 59 years, more than half of a person' lifetime.</p><br>
    <p class = 'project-intro1'>The data on exonerations in the US is collected by <a href = 'http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/about.aspx' target='_blank'>The National Registry of Exonerations</a> project. According to the definition of the project, an exoneration occurs when a person who has been convicted of a crime is officially cleared based on new evidence of innocence; an exoneree is a person who was convicted of a crime and later officially declared innocent of that crime.</p>
